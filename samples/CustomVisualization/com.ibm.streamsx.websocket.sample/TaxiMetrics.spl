This is somewhat an involved IBM Streams application that
has a few modular blocks of logic/code. That includes ingesting
base64 encoded data files, identifying out of sequence events,
performing Geofence, applying custom written event time
based windowing for the analytics and incorporating a new way to
visualize the results in a full-fledged web browser based
custom dashboard application. So, learning about the full
application logic will take a considerable amount of time.
However, if the goal is simply to learn about how the custom
visualization is done in the context of this application, 
then that is relatively simpler. One can understand the
core visualiation idea and its implementation with a minimal
effort. That learning can also be applied in other IBM Streams
applications by focusing only on the final section inside the
main composite of this application.

Before doing anything with the code in this file, it is a 
must to first go through the ReadMe.txt file available at the 
top-level directory of this example.

This main composite has the core logic required for the
CustomVisualization example. It ingests Taxi Location and Taxi Booking
data from files. The data is base64 encoded in these files.
We will base64 decode them on the fly and send it downstream
for further analytics. As part of the analytics, we will 
compute several taxi metrics such as the number of taxis 
available for booking in a given time duration,
taxis hired in a given time duration, number of booking requests 
in a given time duration, number of booking requests per
status in a given time duration and the number of taxis reporting 
their meter status in a given time duration. The number of
taxis available for booking and the number of taxis hired can also
be filtered by community id or district name.
This application also raises alerts when supply and demand is not met.

This application can be run in the Distributed mode and then the
results can be visualized in a web browser with this URL:
