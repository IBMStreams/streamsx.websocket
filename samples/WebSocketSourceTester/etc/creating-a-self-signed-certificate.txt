==========================================================
It is necessary for the users to create a Root CA signed 
server side certificate file and point to that file at the time of
starting the IBM Streams application that uses the 
WebSocketSource operator. If the user doesn't point to this file
at the time of starting the application, then the application will
look for a default file named ws-server.pem inside the etc sub-directory
of the application. This certificate will be presented to the
WebSocketSource operator for validation when it establishes a WebSocket 
connection with this application. For doing quick tests, you may save
time and effort needed in getting a proper Root CA signed certificate by
going with a simpler option of creating your own self-signed certificate.
However, you must ensure that using a self-signed certificate is allowed 
in your environment before going that route. We have provided below a 
set of instructions to create a self-signed certificate.
==========================================================
a) On your Linux machine, create a directory: mkdir ~/ws-cert

b) Change to that directory:  cd ~/ws-cert

c) In that directory, create new file named ws-server-ssl.conf, 
   add the following contents, save and close the file. You have to 
   change the C, ST, L, O and OU fields  shown below to suit your environment.
   For IP addresses, you should use the IP addresses of your IBM Streams 
   cluster machine's IP addresses. More specifically, the IP addresses of the 
   machines where you think the WebSocketSource operator might be placed.

[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no
[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = NY
L = Yorktown Heights
O = IBM
OU = AI
CN = cppws.streams
emailAddress = cppws.streams@ibm.com
[v3_req]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
IP.1 = 172.30.49.199
IP.2 = 172.30.49.189
IP.3 = 172.30.49.179
IP.4 = 172.30.49.169

d) Create this sub-directory now: mkdir ~/ws-cert/cert

e) Change to the newly created sub-directory:  cd ~/ws-cert/cert

f) Create a new key and then a self-signed certificate using that key.

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 7300 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ws-server.pem -out ws-server.pem -config ../ws-server-ssl.conf -extensions 'v3_req'

g) Extract just the self-signed certificate into a separate file.

openssl x509 -outform pem -in ws-server.pem -out ibm-streams-server-cppws-crt.pem

h) We are done. You can verify the different parts of the certificate as shown below. Ensure that the IP addresses you entered in your config file show up inside the certificate.

   openssl x509 -noout -text -in ibm-streams-server-cppws-crt.pem
   openssl verify ibm-streams-server-cppws-crt.pem  [You may ignore error 20 since there is no root CA in this self-signed certificate.]
   openssl x509 -in ibm-streams-server-cppws-crt.pem -noout -issuer
   openssl x509 -noout -subject -in ibm-streams-server-cppws-crt.pem

i) At this time, copy the ws-server.pem file to the etc sub-directory of your 
   IBM Streams application that uses the WebSocketSource operator. 
   After copying this file there, you must build your application so that 
   the new ws-server.pem will get added into the SAB file.

j) Use the ibm-streams-server-cppws-crt.pem file to configure the 
   remote WebSocket client's security (trust store) details by following the 
   required steps mandated by the client application.

k) Since it is a self-signed certificate, your client application may 
   give this error at runtime: 
   
   unable to verify the first certificate.

   If you are running your remote client application in your private 
   trusted network, you may consider setting the following Linux environment 
   variable in the terminal window or shell from where your client application
   is started. That will prevent the above mentioned error from happening. 

   export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0

If you are not allowed or not comfortable with this configuration, 
then you must not use a self-signed certificate. Instead, you must 
create a certificate and get it signed by a well-known root CA so that 
your certificate will include the details about the full chain of the 
signers. That will make your remote client application to validate the 
signers properly and not give the error mentioned above.
